            <p>Are you really cool? Do you like doing things that sound super dangerous? Than "Man eater" is the right river for you! This river has been known to EAT MEN (and women) ALIVE!! Come try it if you dare.</p>
            <p>Man eater is a fast moving river flowing through the southern Alps. With plenty of sharp rocks and dizzying drops, you will be entertained from start to finish. Halfway through the journey we will take a break at shore to recuperate and see how many are still alive. After the break we will continue down the river where we will soon come to the most notable fall on this trip. If you have second thoughts this is the last chance to quit.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Don't want to take your kids on a real river? Just "drop" them off at Drop off point. This river is technically a stream, but your kids won't know the difference. Have peace of mind as you row to your death on one of our other rivers.</p>
            <p>Drop off point is a slow river that goes in a loop that takes approximately 20 minutes, so plan your trips in intervals of 20. We'll take 'em around as long as you need. It has a super small fall near the end, but you can still sleep on this river if you want. Works great for nap time.</p>

                <figcaption>Waterfall falls</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Ever thought waterfalls were cooler than rapids? Well this is the trip for you. With over 58 falls on this river you'll get your lifetimes worth of waterfalls. Located at our highest point (aprx. 13500ft) Waterfall falls takes you down almost 5000 feet!</p>
            <p>Waterfall falls takes you on a semi-spiritual journey as you descend the ~6000 feet from start to end. This trip has no breaks (it is not physically possible) so try to keep up with the guide boat. The two tallest falls are located at 10000 feet, halfway through the journey, and then again at 8500 dropping down the final few hundred feet. Parachutes recommended, we do not supply them to customers.</p>

                <figcaption>Gripe waters</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This trip will have you gripping the edge of your seat as you barrel down the rapids taking turns so fast you momentarily feel what it is like to live on Saturn. Our longest, and second highest river, Gripe waters will take about 5 hours from start to finish, but it will like 5 seconds.</p>
            <p>Gripe waters got it's name because some disgruntled customer griped about how boring our trips were. So we came up with a trip so fierce only 2 of our employees dare to brave it. You move so fast you probably won't notice, but Gripe waters will pass underneath an archway made of solid crystal. No we don't know how it got there. There are 4 falls worthy of mention in this trip and they happen in quick session near the end of your 3rd hour. Make sure to hold on to something or they might send you flying.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Our newest river is another trip for your little tykes. This one came up because kids kept complaining and crying things like, "I wanna go home!" Can you guess how it got it's name? Send your kids down this river and they'll never complain again. Parent's all over the world praise this river!</p>
            <p>Spanning only 4 miles, this little river gives your brats something to do instead of cry. This trip has minimal work for our employee to do (coincidentally it's one of our favorites among them) and puts the majority of work on the child. Thence providing them with a a good lesson in responsibility too. This trip has one fall at the end which is seen as the final test for the maledict children. Parents are NOT allowed on this trip.</p>
